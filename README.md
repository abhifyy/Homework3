## Lab 10.11 CIS 2348 LAB: Nutritional information (classes/constructors)

The `FoodItem` class is completed by adding a constructor to initialize a food item. The constructor initializes the name to "None" and all other instance attributes to 0.0 by default. If the constructor is called with a food name, grams of fat, grams of carbohydrates, and grams of protein, the constructor assigns each instance attribute with the appropriate parameter value.

For the complete program that uses the `FoodItem` class, please refer to the following link: [10.11Zybook.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/10.11Zybook.py)

## Lab 10.15 CIS 2348 LAB: Winning team (classes)

The `Team` class implementation is completed. The class method `get_win_percentage()` calculates the win percentage of the team based on the formula: team_wins / (team_wins + team_losses).

For the complete program that uses the `Team` class, please refer to the following link: [10.15zybooks.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/10.15zybooks.py)

## Lab 10.17 CIS 2348 LAB*: Warm up: Online shopping cart (Part 1)

The `ItemToPurchase` class is built with the specified attributes and a default constructor. The `print_item_cost()` method is implemented to print the total cost of the item.

For the complete program that uses the `ItemToPurchase` class, please refer to the following link: [10.17zybooks.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/10.17zybooks.py)

## Lab 10.29 CIS 2348 LAB*: Program: Online shopping cart (Part 2)

The `ItemToPurchase` class is extended to contain a new attribute, `item_description`. The `print_item_description()` method is implemented to print the item's description. The `ShoppingCart` class is built with the specified data attributes and related methods.

For the complete program that extends the online shopping cart, please refer to the following link: [10.29zybooks.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/10.29zybooks.py)

## Lab 11.18 CIS 2348 LAB: Filter and sort a list

Write a program that gets a list of integers from input and outputs non-negative integers in ascending order (lowest to highest).

For the complete program that filters and sorts a list of integers, please refer to the following link: [11.18zybooks.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/11.18zybooks.py)

## Lab 11.22 CIS 2348 LAB: Word frequencies

Write a program that reads a list of words and outputs those words and their frequencies.

For the complete program that counts the frequencies of words, please refer to the following link: [11.22zybooks.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/11.22zybooks.py)

## Lab 11.27 CIS 2348 LAB*: Program: Soccer team roster (Dictionaries)

This program stores roster and rating information for a soccer team. Coaches rate players during tryouts to ensure a balanced team.

For the complete program that manages a soccer team roster using dictionaries, please refer to the following link: [11.27zybooks.py](https://github.com/abhifyy/Homework3/blob/main/11.27zybooks.py)
